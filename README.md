# Competitive Programming Archive 

This repository has lots of problems of competitive programing I solved through the years I'm training. The first ones I made are in C# and they are of the brazilian page URI Online Judge. I solved them in 2017 and more recentily I'm coding for sites like CodeForces, SPOJ and Neps.


If a file is in the root folder, that means I'm trying to pass that problem right now. When I solve a problem, I send the file to its respective directory. Then, I can know the history of problems I made.


I try to have a good pattern in the names of files. So files from Neps or URI are named by the problem's number, the same for CodeForces but with the letter of the problem at the end. For SPOJ I use the problem's code (which is some capital letters and numbers at the end).


Nowadays I'm coding in C++. Some of my accounts are:
